# Polar Billing Option

Use this when the product should sell through Polar checkout sessions and later map orders, subscriptions, or benefits into app entitlements.

Install only if selected:

```sh
bun add @polar-sh/sdk
```

Environment:

```env
POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=
POLAR_SERVER=sandbox
POLAR_PRODUCT_PRO=
```

Activation checklist:

1. Copy `billing-adapter.ts.example` to `src/lib/server/billing/provider.ts`.
2. Keep `POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` server-side only.
3. Create checkout sessions from server routes or Convex actions, never from client components.
4. Store `external_customer_id` as the app user ID.
5. Add webhook handling before granting paid access.
6. Remove Autumn or other billing providers after Polar checkout and entitlement sync work.
